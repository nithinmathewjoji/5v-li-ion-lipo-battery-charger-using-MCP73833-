The MCP73833/4 is a highly advanced linear charge
management controller for use in space-limited, cost
sensitive applications. The MCP73833/4 is available in
a 10-Lead, 3 mm x 3 mm DFN package or a 10-Lead,
MSOP package. Along with its small physical size, the
low number of external components required makes
the MCP73833/4 ideally suited for portable
applications. For applications charging from a USB
port, the MCP73833/4 can adhere to all the
specifications governing the USB power bus.
The MCP73833/4 employs a constant current/constant
voltage charge algorithm with selectable preconditioning and charge termination. The constant voltage
regulation is fixed with four available options: 4.20V,
4.35V, 4.40V, or 4.50V, to accomodate new, emerging
battery charging requirements. The constant current
value is set with one external resistor. The MCP73833/
4 limits the charge current based on die temperature
during high power or high ambient conditions. This
thermal regulation optimizes the charge cycle time
while maintaining device reliability.
Several options are available for the preconditioning
threshold, preconditioning current value, charge
termination value, and automatic recharge threshold.
The preconditioning value and charge termination
value are set as a ratio, or percentage, of the
programmed constant current value. Preconditioning
can be set to 100%. Refer to Section 1.0 “Electrical
Characteristics” for available options and the
“Product Indentification System” for standard
options.
The MCP73833/4 is fully specified over the ambient
temperature range of -40°C to +85°C
